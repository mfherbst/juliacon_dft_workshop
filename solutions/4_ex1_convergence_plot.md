### Solution for the exercise "Gaining insight" in 4_Solving_the_SCF_problem.ipynb

As the number of repeats is increasing the convergence plot becomes more and more rough
and less monotonous. In particular:
  - The density change from iteration to iteration sometimes shows spikes, instead
    of a nice monotonous decrease.
  - In the initial phase of the SCF both density and energy show drastic oscillations
    (including energy changes to very positive energies)
