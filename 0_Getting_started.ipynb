    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/dftkfields.png\" width=40% align=\"right\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "- Electronic structure theory is a fascinating interdisciplinary field\n",
    "- Why bother? -> See [my JuliaCon 2020 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RomkxjlIcQ)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple philosophies and general approaches exist\n",
    "- Focus of this workshop:\n",
    "    * Solid-state problems (crystals, lattices, ...)\n",
    "    * Plane-wave discretisations\n",
    "    * Density functional theory (DFT)\n",
    "    * Highly successful, but still many open mathematical problems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topics:\n",
    "    * Specialities of periodic problems\n",
    "    * Mathematical formulation of the DFT\n",
    "    * Numerical solution using the self-consistent field (SCF) procedure\n",
    "    * Numerical tools for analysis and understanding convergence\n",
    "    * Opportunities for modern software programming techniques (tracking floating-point error, automatic differentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goals:\n",
    "    * Allow applied mathematicians to gain access to the topic\n",
    "    * Allow practitioners to deepen mathematical insight\n",
    "    * Introduce the [density-functional toolkit](https://dftk.org)\n",
    "      and its interplay with the Julia package ecosystom."

    "\n",
    "- The examples in this notebook were primarily chosen to be quick to run and yield mathematical insight. In particular:\n",
    "    * Parameters will not give fully converged results\n",
    "    * Not all examples make physical sense (i.e. it might be better to model things differently in practice)\n",

    "- I have prepared:\n",
